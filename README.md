Nexus: The Atlas of Knowledge
The Problem We're Solving
Ever felt like you're lost in a labyrinth of links and PDFs, desperately searching for a single, clear answer? Today's research tools are broken. They give us scattered fragments of information, leaving us to connect the dots ourselves. This leads to wasted hours, shallow understanding, and the risk of working with outdated or untrustworthy facts.

We're building Nexus to be your compass in this chaos. Nexus isn't just a search engine; it's a living library, an intelligent assistant that finds, connects, and clarifies information for you.

What Makes Nexus Special?
The Aether of Information: We pull data from everywhere—your personal files, a firehose of live web content—and seamlessly weave it together into a coherent narrative.

The Compass of Clarity: Nexus doesn't just give you a wall of text. It synthesizes insights into a clear, concise report, so you can absorb the knowledge, not just the data.

The Seal of Authenticity: Every fact in a Nexus report is a thread that leads back to its source. We ensure every insight is evidence-based and verifiable, so you can trust the information.

The Living Library: Thanks to Pathway, Nexus is a dynamic, living entity. It stays up-to-date with new information, so your reports automatically refresh with the latest news and insights.

Our Journey
This project was forged in the fires of [mention the event, e.g., "HackWithHyderabad"] with a simple vision: to make deep, reliable research accessible to everyone.

The Toolkit
Frontend: A beautiful, responsive UI built with React.js.

Backend: A powerful, scalable agent written in Python.

Database: Firebase Firestore for real-time data storage.

Intelligence: A cutting-edge Large Language Model (LLM).

The Pulse: Pathway to keep our knowledge base alive and current.

The Credit Engine: Flexprice to power our pay-per-report monetization.

How to Join the Quest
To run Nexus locally and join our quest for clarity:

Prerequisites
Node.js

Python

A Firebase project

API keys for Pathway and Flexprice

Setup
Start your journey:

git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[Your-GitHub-Username]/[Your-Repository-Name].git
cd [Your-Repository-Name]

Ignite the backend:

cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
